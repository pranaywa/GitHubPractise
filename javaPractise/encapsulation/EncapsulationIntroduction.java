// To acheive the security for our functionality for that we are using the encapsulation concept.
// Encapsulation is the combination of data hiding and abstractions.
// data hiding means calling the private variable of class level in to the public method of that particular class.
// abstraction means calling that public method in which we call the private variable in to another class.
