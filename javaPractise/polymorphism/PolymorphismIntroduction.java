public class PolymorphismIntroduction {
//Polymorphism is the concept of Opps Object oriented programming 
//By Polymorphism we can acheive the portability means one enity can have logics
//Poly mean many and morphism means form combine it became many forms
//Polymorphism are of two types overloading and overriding.
//Overloading means same method and argument is different.Same method can have different logic 
//The condition for overloading is two - same method name and the different argument.
//Access modifier and return type doesnot make any different if we defing the overloaded method.
//Overloaded method execution is based on the class object reference variable
//Constructor can be overloaded as there name is based on class and argument we define different in constructors
//Overloading is also called and static polymorphism or compiletime polymorphism.
	
//Overiding is same method and different and the relation of inheritance.
//Conditions to be statisfied for the method to make it overided are
//method name is same, Argument is also same and there should be the relationship of inheritance after that 
//only we can able to overidie a method of parent classs in the child class.
//Access modifier of overided method should be same or greater than the parent method.
//Consturctors doesnot follow the overiding because constructor doesnot follows the inheritance concept
//in overiding we have to use the inheritance concept.
//Overiding is called the dynamic polymorphism or the runtime polymorphism.
//Because the execution is based on the object the child class. it will only the method of child class
//if we want to call the method of parent than we have to create the object of parent in the child class.
