//for acheving the reusability we can the inheritance.
//Inheritance allow the class inherit or use the operities of the other class which it extends to it 
//For Inhritance we have the provoide keyword in the child class extends to parent class
//Inheritance are of two type single level inheritance and multilevel inheritance
//Multiple inheritance is not possible because it introduce the diamond ambiquity means complier not understand which method to call
// if we child have two parent class and both contains the same methods.In that situation diamond ambiquity introduce.
//To handle the diamond ambiquity we need to use the interface for that as can have multiple inheritance possible in it.
//Constructor doesnot follow the inheritance as we create the object class and parent have the constructor so child class object
//first call the parent class constructor and then second child class constructor.
